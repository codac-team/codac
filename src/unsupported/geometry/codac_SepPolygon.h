 *
 * \brief Separator for Point inside a polygon.
 *
 * This separator can be used even if the polygon is not convex
 *
 * The polygon is defined by an union of oriented
 * segment given in counter-clockwise order.
 *
 * Example :
 *  The polygon ABCDE is composed of 5 segments
 *  AB -- BC -- CD -- DE -- EA
 *
 *
 * A------------------------------- E

 *   -                          -
 *    -                       -

 *        -     Polygon       -
 *         -                   -
 *          -                   - C

 *
 * Principle
 *
 * To our knowledge, no explicit contractor for the constraint
 * "Point in inside the polygon" exists when the polygon is non convex. Only a contractor
 * for the border is available.
 * To solve this issue, with an inner an outer set,
 * the separator approach needs to be used.
 * From an initial box, the minimal contractor on the border of the polygon is called
 * and a test is used to classify each removed part into x_in and x_out.
