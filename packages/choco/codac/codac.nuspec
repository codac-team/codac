Codac is a library providing tools for constraint programming over reals, trajectories and sets.

## Quick start
- After [installing Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), run `choco install -y codac cmake make qtcreator` in PowerShell and then launch Qt Creator and choose Open Project, open `test_codac\CMakelists.txt` (get the folder from https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/lebars/Share/test_codac.zip), ensure Desktop is selected and click Configure Project, wait 10 s then click on the big bottom green Run button, finally check that "My first tube:Tube [0, 10]" appears.
- Optionally, download and run https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/VIBES/releases/download/0.2.3/VIBes-0.2.3-win32.exe before running the project, and check that a tube appears in VIBes window.

## Troubleshooting
- Check that all the packages and their dependencies were installed, if one failed (e.g. due to network-related errors) try to reinstall it using `--force` or try a previous version...
- 32 bit versions of Qt Creator do not seem available any more, see https://github.com/AdmiringWorm/chocolatey-packages/issues/362.
- If multiple compilers are already installed, Qt Creator might show multiple possibilities in the Configure Project panel, ensure you choose one compatible with https://chocolatey.org/packages/codac#dependencies.

## Package parameters
The following package parameters can be set:
- `/url:URL` - Will install the specified binary package (e.g. built for Visual Studio), see versions from https://github.com/codac-team/codac/releases (the Windows `PATH` might need to be updated manually with e.g. `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\ibex\bin`, etc.). By default, only the MinGW libraries compatible with the corresponding MinGW Chocolatey package dependency are installed. Use the standard parameter `choco install --ignore-dependencies ...` to avoid installing the default MinGW and IBEX Chocolatey package dependencies if needed (you might want to install manually [IBEX](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ibex) package with the corresponding parameters, as well as the corresponding compiler and the Eigen package).
- `/checksum:SHA256` - SHA256 checksum of the binary package specified by the `/url` parameter. If needed, use the standard parameter `choco install --ignore-checksums ...` for trusted sources.
- `/urlX:URL` - Same as above, with X in [1,99], except this will not disable the installation of the MinGW libraries compatible with the corresponding MinGW Chocolatey package dependency.
- `/checksumX:SHA256` - SHA256 checksum of the binary package specified by the `/urlX` parameter. If needed, use the standard parameter `choco install --ignore-checksums ...` for trusted sources.
- `/InstallDir:INSTALLDIR` - Installation directory.
- `/Path` - Will try to update Windows `PATH`.
- `/NoRegistry` - Will not try to update Windows registry.
To pass package parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install codac --params "'/Path /NoRegistry'"`), and to install another binary package, try e.g.
```
choco install -y chocolatey-core.extension
choco install -y --ignore-dependencies codac --params "'/url:https://github.com/codac-team/codac/releases/download/v1/codac_x64_vc17.zip'"
```
