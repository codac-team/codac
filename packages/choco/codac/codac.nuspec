Codac is a library providing tools for constraint programming over reals, trajectories and sets.

## Quick start
- After [installing Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), run `choco install -y codac cmake make qtcreator` in PowerShell and then launch Qt Creator and choose Open Project, open `test_codac\CMakelists.txt` (get the folder from https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/lebars/Share/test_codac.zip), ensure Desktop is selected and click Configure Project, wait 10 s then click on the big bottom green Run button, finally check that "My first tube:Tube [0, 10]" appears.
- Optionally, download and run https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/VIBES/releases/download/0.2.3/VIBes-0.2.3-win32.exe before running the project, and check that a tube appears in VIBes window.

## Troubleshooting
- Check that all the packages and their dependencies were installed, if one failed (e.g. due to network-related errors) try to reinstall it using --force or try a previous version...
- 32 bit versions of latest Qt Creator do not seem available, if needed use `choco install -y qtcreator --version=4.13.3 --x86 --force`
- If multiple compilers are already installed, Qt Creator might show multiple possibilities in the Configure Project panel, ensure you choose one compatible with https://chocolatey.org/packages/codac#dependencies.
